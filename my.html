QUICK FIRE QUESTIONS TO THE MASSES..

DEFINE:

NETWORKING -
Networking is the process of transporting and exchanging data between nodes over a shared
medium in an information system.

Protocol - An established set of rules that 
determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network.

Interface - A point of connection between a computer and a public or private network.

port - A number assigned to uniquely identify a connection endpoint 
       and to direct data to a specific service.
    </pre>

  <section id="drivers">
    <h2>üåê NETWORK DRIVERS</h2>
    <pre>
NETWORK DRIVERS.
A network driver is a software that activates the actual transmission and 
receipt of data over the network.

*****************************************************************************************************************

types of network drivers

Bridge - This is the default network driver. 
Usually used when applications need to run in standalone containers that need to communicate.
a good example would be You're developing a web app with a frontend and backend, 
running both in containers on your local machine.

Host - The container shares the host's network stack. No isolation.

This means that : No separate IP address for the container.

The container uses the host‚Äôs IP address.

Ports opened in the container are directly exposed on the host ‚Äî no port mapping (-p) needed.

Overlay - Used to connect containers 
     running on different Docker hosts. Works in Docker Swarm mode.
	 a good example is You‚Äôre building a distributed app where parts 
	 of the system run on different machines (like a frontend on one server and a 
	 DB on another), but they still need to talk to each other securely.

IPvlan - IPvlan networks give users total control over IPv4 and IPv6 addressing. 
 This Allows you to assign custom IP addresses to containers on a parent network interface.
 
 A good example would be When you want containers to be part of your existing network, 
    like assigning them IPs from your company LAN (for compliance or DHCP tracking).

Macvlan - Macvlan networks allow you to assign a MAC address to a container, 
making it appear as a physical device on your network LAN.
Best for legacy applications that need to be directly connected to the physical network.

None - Does not assign a network address to a container.  

-- No network connection. Total isolation.
used when one is trying to run a tool that shouldn‚Äôt talk to the internet or any other container.

WHEN YOU INSTALL DOCKER THE DEFAULT NETWORK BRIDGES ARE :
NONE, HOST AND BRIDGE

Network plugins - You can install and use third-party network plugins with docker

    <h2>üì¶ CONTAINER NETWORKING</h2>
    <pre>
Container Networking.

A container "thinks" it's just on a normal network ‚Äî 
it doesn't know whether it's on a bridge, overlay, or host network. All it sees is an IP, 
gateway, etc., unless it‚Äôs using the none network driver, in which case it has no network access.
    </pre>
  </section>

  <section id="ports">
    <h2>üîå PUBLISHED PORTS</h2>
    <pre>
Published ports.

By default, when you start a container with docker run, none of its ports are accessible from outside the container.
If you want to allow external access ‚Äî either from outside Docker or from containers on other networks ‚Äî you need to use the --publish (or -p) option.

For example: -p 8080:80 maps port 80 inside the container to port 8080 on the host machine

docker network ls      --- show all the docker based networks in our computer.
docker network create solar-system   ---- create a network
docker network ls  ---- check if our chapatis are there.(bridge is the default driver)
    </pre>

  <section id="terminal">
    <h2>üíª LET'S GO TO THE TERMINAL</h2>
    <pre>
LETS GO TO THE TERMINAL >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

TO SPECIFY THE NETWORK DRIVER THAT YOU WANT TO USE 

docker network create --driver  host  milky-way -- these will not run

docker network create --driver  null milky-way   -- these will not run

docker network create --driver bridge solar-system  -- (here you can add pools of 
computers and call them nodes)
docker network ls

docker run --rm --it --name earth --network solar-system  busybox sh

OPEN A NEW TERMINAL

INSPECT IF THE CONTAINER IS RUNNING 
docker ps
docker inspect earth   --- check the network section show the network attached if it is solar-system

docker run --rm --it --name mars --network solar-system  alpine sh

INSPECT IF THE CONTAINER IS RUNNING 
docker ps
docker inspect mars   --- check the network section show the network attached if it is solar-system

docker network  ls
docker network inspect solar-system

you will see the ip-address but no worries the name of the container will suffice 
because of DNS.
 ping earth         --- from mars
 ping mars         --- from earth
 
 try attach an existing network to another  container different from these ones 
 
docker run --rm --it --name blackhole --network energy  alpine sh
