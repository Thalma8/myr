DEFINE:

NETWORKING -
Networking is the process of transporting and exchanging data between nodes over a shared
medium in an information system.

Protocol - An established set of rules that 
determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network.

Interface - A point of connection between a computer and a public or private network.

port - A number assigned to uniquely identify a connection endpoint 
       and to direct data to a specific service.

    <h2>🌐 NETWORK DRIVERS</h2>
    <pre>
NETWORK DRIVERS.
A network driver is a software that activates the actual transmission and 
receipt of data over the network.

*****************************************************************************************************************

types of network drivers

Bridge - This is the default network driver. 
Usually used when applications need to run in standalone containers that need to communicate.
a good example would be You're developing a web app with a frontend and backend, 
running both in containers on your local machine.

Host - The container shares the host's network stack. No isolation.

This means that : No separate IP address for the container.

The container uses the host’s IP address.

Ports opened in the container are directly exposed on the host — no port mapping (-p) needed.

Overlay - Used to connect containers 
     running on different Docker hosts. Works in Docker Swarm mode.
	 a good example is You’re building a distributed app where parts 
	 of the system run on different machines (like a frontend on one server and a 
	 DB on another), but they still need to talk to each other securely.

IPvlan - IPvlan networks give users total control over IPv4 and IPv6 addressing. 
 This Allows you to assign custom IP addresses to containers on a parent network interface.
 
 A good example would be When you want containers to be part of your existing network, 
    like assigning them IPs from your company LAN (for compliance or DHCP tracking).

Macvlan - Macvlan networks allow you to assign a MAC address to a container, 
making it appear as a physical device on your network LAN.
Best for legacy applications that need to be directly connected to the physical network.

None - Does not assign a network address to a container.  

-- No network connection. Total isolation.
used when one is trying to run a tool that shouldn’t talk to the internet or any other container.

WHEN YOU INSTALL DOCKER THE DEFAULT NETWORK BRIDGES ARE :
NONE, HOST AND BRIDGE

Network plugins - You can install and use third-party network plugins with docker

TO UNDERSTAND ALL THE ABOVE REALLY WELL PLEASE OPEN THIS LINK AND 
PRACTICALLY DO THE CODE INNIT ..

  <section id="container">
    <h2>📦 CONTAINER NETWORKING</h2>
    <pre>
Container Networking.

A container "thinks" it's just on a normal network — 
it doesn't know whether it's on a bridge, overlay, or host network. All it sees is an IP, 
gateway, etc., unless it’s using the none network driver, in which case it has no network access.
    </pre>
  </section>

  <section id="ports">
    <h2>🔌 PUBLISHED PORTS</h2>
    <pre>
Published ports.

By default, when you start a container with docker run, none of its ports are accessible from outside the container.
If you want to allow external access — either from outside Docker or from containers on other networks — you need to use the --publish (or -p) option.

For example: -p 8080:80 maps port 80 inside the container to port 8080 on the host machine

docker network ls      --- show all the docker based networks in our computer.
docker network create solar-system   ---- create a network
docker network ls  ---- check if our chapatis are there.(bridge is the default driver)
    </pre>
  </section>

  <section id="terminal">
    <h2>💻 LET'S GO TO THE TERMINAL</h2>
    <pre>
LETS GO TO THE TERMINAL >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

TO SPECIFY THE NETWORK DRIVER THAT YOU WANT TO USE 

docker network create --driver  host  milky-way -- these will not run

docker network create --driver  null milky-way   -- these will not run

docker network create --driver bridge solar-system  -- (here you can add pools of 
computers and call them nodes)
docker network ls

docker run --rm --it --name earth --network solar-system  busybox sh

OPEN A NEW TERMINAL

INSPECT IF THE CONTAINER IS RUNNING 
docker ps
docker inspect earth   --- check the network section show the network attached if it is solar-system

docker run --rm --it --name mars --network solar-system  alpine sh

INSPECT IF THE CONTAINER IS RUNNING 
docker ps
docker inspect mars   --- check the network section show the network attached if it is solar-system

docker network  ls
docker network inspect solar-system

you will see the ip-address but no worries the name of the container will suffice 
because of DNS.
 ping earth         --- from mars
 ping mars         --- from earth
 
 try attach an existing network to another  container different from these ones 
 
docker run --rm --it --name blackhole --network energy  alpine sh
